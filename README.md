# SaleCheck: Internal Wiki

## Note
This wiki is currently implemented as a `git submodule` rather than using GitHubâ€™s [native Wiki feature](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages).

Ideally, we would use the GitHub Wiki system, but it is only available for **public repositories** or repositories on a **paid plan**.

Until the project is either open-sourced or upgraded to a paid tier, this submodule serves as a alternative solution for internal documentation purposes.
